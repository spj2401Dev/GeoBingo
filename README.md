Download the Repo and open in up in your favorite IDE. Then install all the required packages.

```
npm i
```

After that create a `config.json` file in the root of the project, which should look like this:

```json
  {
   "WebSocket":{
      "Ip":"127.0.0.1",
      "Port":8080
   },
   "Api":{
      "Ip":"127.0.0.1",
      "Port":8000
   }
}
```

Like this its configured to run on your localhost. Then you just have to configure the Client to connect to the right WebSocket. Go to /client/resources/webSocketService.mjs. There you should see an IP adresse. Just change this to the same then you configured in the config.json
After that just run the project using

```
npm start
```

or use nodemon, to automatically restart the server once you saved a file. (Often not recommended, because all the game data is stored in the runtime. Meaning restarting the server resets the game)

```
npm run dev
```

### Setting Default words

In GeoBingo you can set default words, which will be randomly choosen if you dont fill out all the words. You can find those in /src/utility/wordsList.mjs. In there just put the Words you want to use.
